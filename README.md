Continuation of my study of C# and SQL Databases using the "Visual C# and Databases - 2019 Edition" <br>
This example is from chapter 9 in the book. <br> Although the book uses WinForms and puts all the code in the code behind
I will be adapting it for WPF with the MVVM design pattern and using ADO.net for reading and writing to a SQL Server database <br>
It also contains the sql script to create the database needed, this can be found int the SqlScripts folder in the DataAccessLibrary.
